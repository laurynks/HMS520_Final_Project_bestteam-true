## HMS 520 Final Project for bestTeam <- TRUE, which includes Jessica Bishai (jbishai@uw.edu) and Lauryn Stafford (laurynks@uw.edu).

Our project is to create a package containing four general functions that are applicable to many IHME projects. The MAD Outliering function takes a dataset, such as a bundle version, and outliers data based on median absolute deviation and other data grouping parameters. The ST-GPR to DisMod and DisMod to ST-GPR bundle converter functions allow conversion from DisMod shape bundles and ST-GPR shape bundles. The Weighted Means function allows comparability between data using different age groups by calculating a mean weighted by population using each component age group to produce an estimate or the overall age group.

*Note: This repo is still in progress, but we won't push any changes that cause the code to break-- just working on efficiency/usability improvements!*
