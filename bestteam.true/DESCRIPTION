Description: This package contains four general functions that are applicable to 
              many IHME projects. The MAD Outliering function takes a dataset, such
              as a bundle version, and outliers data based on median absolute 
              deviation and other data grouping parameters. The ST-GPR to DisMod 
              and DisMod to ST-GPR bundle converter functions allow conversion from DisMod
              shape bundles and ST-GPR shape bundles. The Weighted Means function 
              allows comparability between data using different age groups by 
              calculating a mean weighted by population using each component age
              group to produce an estimate or the overall age group.
